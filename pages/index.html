            <div><p class="yellow">Due to extra time by myself while studying finance in Italy,</p> <p>I discovered a love for
                programming. Starting with Java and swiftly moving into the world of web development, it began to consume all of 
                my free time. While I graduated with a economics degree, I knew I wanted to spend my life learning
                and writing code. As a self taught developer, I am already commited to explore the unknown, building upon my 
                skills every day with a hunger to improve. Whether it be collaborating with a team or building webapps from my 
                home office, I am driven by the desire to create applications that provide value to those that use them
